# gtcloud-lanl: A repo to host codes and data for geothermal resource exploration research between Los Alamos National Laboratories and collaborators 
- Collaborators are: United States Geological Survey, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, University of Hawaii, Buraue of Economic Geology-UT, Tosidoh LLC, and EGS Collab. 
- Works in this directory were performed using a novel unsupervised machine learning code called NMFk (https://tensors.lanl.gov/). If you have any questions regarding this code, please email us at vvv@lanl.gov or ahmmedb@lanl.gov
# A brief description about each directory
- brady directory hosts data, codes, figures that are generated for our paper: Machine learning to identify geologic factors associated with production in geothermal fields: A casestudy
using 3D geologic data, Brady geothermal field, Nevada. This paper is under review in the Journal of Geothermal Energy. We collaborated this work with USGS. Drew Siler and Jeff Peppin are Scientists at USGS. They are experts in geothermal exploration. 
- swnm: will host data and codes for geothermal exploration research in southwest New Mexico.
