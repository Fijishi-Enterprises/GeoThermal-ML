This notebook demonstrates how the **NMFk** module of **SmartTensors** can be applied to perform unsupervised geothermal machine-learning analyses.

More information on how the ML results are interpreted to provide geothermal insights is discussed in our research paper.

## Import required Julia modules

If **NMFk** is not installed, first execute in the Julia REPL `import Pkg; Pkg.add("NMFk"); Pkg.add("DelimitedFiles"); Pkg.add("JLD"); Pkg.add("Gadfly"); Pkg.add("Cairo"); Pkg.add("Fontconfig"); Pkg.add("Mads")`.


## Load and pre-process the dataset

### Setup the working directory containing the Brady site data

### Load the data file

### Populate the missing well names

### Set up missing entries to be equal to zero

### Define names of the data attributes (matrix columns)

Short attribute names are used for coding.

Long attribute names are used for plotting and visualization.

### Define the attributes that will be processed

### Index the attributes that will be processed

### Display information about the processed data (min, max, count):

### Get well locations and production

### Define well types

### Display information about processed well attributes

### Collect the well data into a 3D tensor

Tensor indices (dimensions) define depths, attributes, and wells.

### Define the maximum depth

The maximum depth limits the depth of the data included in the analyses.

The maximum depth is set to 750 m.

### Normalize tensor slices associated with each attribute

### Define problem setup variables

### Plot well data

A HTML file named [../map/dataset-set00-v9-inv.html](../map/dataset-set00-v9-inv.html) is generated mapping the site data.
The map provides interactive visualization of the site data (it can also be opened with any browser).

The map below shows the location of the `Dry`, `Injection` and `Production` wells.

## Perform ML analyses

For the ML analyses, the data tensor can be flattened into a data matrix by using two different approaches:

- Type 1: Merge depth and attribute tensor dimensions; in this way, the focus of the ML analysis is on finding the features associated with the well locations
- Type 2: Merge depth and location tensor dimensions; in this way, the focus of the ML analysis is on finding the features associated with the well attributes

After that the **NMFk** algorithm will factorize the data matrix `X` into `W` and `H` matrices. For more information, check out the [**NMFk** website](https://github.com/SmartTensors/NMFk.jl)

### Type 1 flattening: Focus on well locations

#### Flatten the tensor into a matrix

Matrix rows merge the depth and attribute dimensions.

Matrix columns represent the well locations.

#### Perform NMFk analyses

Here, the **NMFk** results are loaded from a prior ML run.

As seen from the output above, the **NMFk** analyses identified that the optimal number of geothermal signatures in the dataset **6**.

Solutions with a number of signatures less than **6** are underfitting.

Solutions with a number of signatures greater than **6** are overfitting and unacceptable.

The set of acceptable solutions are defined by the **NMFk** algorithm as follows:

The acceptable solutions contain 2, 5 and 6 signatures.

#### Post-process NMFk results

#### Number of signatures

Below is a plot representing solution quality (fit) and silhouette width (robustness) for different numbers of signatures `k`:

The plot above also demonstrates that the acceptable solutions contain 2, 5 and 6 signatures.

#### Analysis of all the acceptable solutions

The ML solutions containing an acceptable number of signatures are further analyzed as follows:

The results for a solution with **6** signatures presented above will be further discussed here.

The well attributes are clustered into **6** groups:

      width="95%"></iframe>
  </p>
</div>

This grouping is based on analyses of the attribute matrix `W`:

![attributes-6-labeled-sorted](../figures-set00-v9-inv-750-1000-daln/attributes-6-labeled-sorted.png)

Note that the attribute matrix `W` is automatically modified to account that a range of vertical depths is applied in characterizing the site wells.

The well locations are also clustered into **6** groups:

  </p>
</div>

This grouping is based on analyses of the location matrix `H`:

The map [../figures-set00-v9-inv-750-1000-daln/locations-6-map.html](../figures-set00-v9-inv-750-1000-daln/locations-6-map.html) provides interactive visualization of the extracted well location groups (the html file can also be opened with any browser).

Matrix columns represent the well attributes.

#### Perform NMFk analyses

Here the **NMFk** results are loaded from a prior ML run.

As seen from the output above, the **NMFk** analyses identified that the optimal number of geothermal signatures in the dataset **3**.

Solutions with a number of signatures less than **3** are underfitting.

Solutions with a number of signatures greater than **3** are overfitting and unacceptable.

The set of acceptable solutions are defined by the **NMFk** algorithm as follows:

The acceptable solutions contain 2 and 3 signatures.

#### Post-process NMFk results

#### Number of signatures

Below is a plot representing solution quality (fit) and silhouette width (robustness) for different numbers of signatures `k`:

The plot above also demonstrates that the acceptable solutions contain 2 and 3 signatures.

#### Analysis of all the acceptable solutions

The ML solutions containing an acceptable number of signatures are further analyzed as follows:

#### Analysis of the 3-signature solution

The results for a solution with **3** signatures presented above will be further discussed here.

The well attributes are clustered into **3** groups:
