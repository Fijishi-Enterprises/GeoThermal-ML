## Introduction

Southwest New Mexico (**SWNM**) is a region important for geothermal exploration.

**SWNM** is broadly divided into four physiographic provinces:
 - the Colorado Plateau
 - the Mogollon-Datil Volcanic Field (MDVF)
 - the Basin and Range, and
 - the Rio Grande rift.

Each of the **SWNM** physiographic provinces is associated with different types of unique hydrothermal systems with temperatures ranging from low (<90℃) to medium (90-150℃).

Some of the **SWNM** systems are already utilized for commercial and recreational purposes.

There are already energy-production facilities for both electricity and direct-use heating.

For example, the Basin and Range province has one geothermal power plant (Lightning dock) of gross ~14 MWe power, five greenhouse farms, and numerous medium-temperature wells and springs.
There are 14 spas and recreational facilities utilizing the **SWNM** geothermal resources.

Recent Play Fairway Analysis (PFA) Phase I study of **SWNM** conducted at LANL revealed more potential geothermal resources.

The study area and the data collection locations are mapped below.

## Import required libraries for this work

If **NMFk** is not installed, first execute in the Julia REPL `import Pkg; Pkg.add("NMFk"); Pkg.add("DelimitedFiles"); Pkg.add("JLD"); Pkg.add("Gadfly"); Pkg.add("Cairo"); Pkg.add("Fontconfig"); Pkg.add("Mads")`.

## Load and pre-process the data

### Setup the working directory containing the SWNM data

### Load the SWNM data file

### Define names of the data attributes (matrix columns)

Short attribute names are used for coding.

Long attribute names are used for plotting and visualization.

### Define attributes to remove from analysis

### Define attributes for analysis

### Define names of the data locations

Short location names are used for coding.

Long location names are used for plotting and visualization.

### Define location coordinates

### Set up directories to store obtained results and figures

### Define a range for the number of signatures to be explored

### Define and normalize the data matrix

## Perform ML analyses

The **NMFk** algorithm factorizes the normalized data matrix `Xu` into `W` and `H` matrices. For more information, check out the [**NMFk** website](https://github.com/SmartTensors/NMFk.jl)

Here, the **NMFk** results are loaded from a prior ML run.

As seen from the output above, the NMFk analyses identified that the optimal number of geothermal signatures in the dataset **5**.
This estimate is based on a criterion that `Silhouette` (`robustness`) of the acceptable solutions is >0.5.
However, if a criterion for `Silhouette` is >0.25, the optimal number of signatures is **8**.

It is important to note that our ML methodology can be applied to perform both **classification** and **regression** analyses.

For the case of **regression** (predictive) analyses, the optimal number of signatures is **5**.

Solutions with a number of signatures less than **5** are underfitting.

Solutions with a number of signatures greater than **5** are overfitting and unacceptable.

The solution for `k=8` is also analyzed below because it provides further refinements in the extracted geothermal signatures.
It also provides further demonstration of the **classification** capabilities of our ML methodology.

The set of acceptable solutions are defined by the **NMFk** algorithm as follows:

The acceptable solutions contain 2, 3, 4, and 5 signatures.

### Post-process NMFk results

#### Number of signatures

Below is a plot representing solution quality (fit) and silhouette width (robustness) for different numbers of signatures `k`:

The plot above also demonstrates that the acceptable solutions contain 2, 3, 4, and 5 signatures.

#### Analysis of all the acceptable solutions

The ML solutions containing an acceptable number of signatures are further analyzed as follows:

#### Analysis of the 5-signature solution

The results for a solution with **5** signatures presented above will be further discussed here.

The geothermal attributes are clustered into **5** groups:


This grouping is based on analyses of the attribute matrix `W`:

![attributes-5-labeled-sorted](../figures-case01/attributes-5-labeled-sorted.png)

The well locations are also clustered into **5** groups:

This grouping is based on analyses of the location matrix `H`:

![locations-5-labeled-sorted](../figures-case01/locations-5-labeled-sorted.png)

The map [../figures-case01/locations-5-map.html](../figures-case01/locations-5-map.html) provides interactive visualization of the extracted location groups (the html file can also be opened within any browser).

#### Comparison of the ML solutions against the SWNM physiographic provinces

The spatial association of the extracted signatures with the four physiographic provinces in SWNM is summarized in the figure below:

![signatures](../figures-case01/signatures.png)

The solutions for k=2, 3, and 4 provide a higher-level classification of the geothermal locations, while the k=8 solution allow us to further refine the geothermal signatures and their association to the physiographic provinces.
The solution for k=5 provides the best classification of the geothermal locations.

Based on the figure above, it is clear that our ML algorithm was able to blindly identify the physiographic provinces associated with analyzed hydrogeothermal systems without providing any information about their spatial location (coordinates).

Further observations based on the figure above are:

- The solution for k=2 separates the Colorado Plateau and the Volcanic Field (Signature A) from the Basin and Range and the Rift zone (Signature B) provinces (Figure a).
- The k=3 solution combines the Colorado Plateau and the Volcanic Field in Signature A; however, Signatures B and C separate the Basin and Range and the Rio Grande Rift provinces, respectively (Figure b).
- Signature A of the k=4 solution (Figure c) represents the Volcanic Field. Signature B captures the Basin and Range province. Signature C coincides with the Colorado Plateau. Signature D encompasses the Rio Grande Rift zone (Figure c).
- The k=5 solution (Figure d) regroups the four signatures of the k=4 solution into five signatures. Signatures A and E cover MDVF; Signatures B, C, and D capture the remaining three provinces: the Basin and Range, the Colorado Plateau, and the Rio Grande Rift provinces, respectively.
- In the k=8 solution (Figure e), Signature B captures the Colorado Plateau province. Signatures G and H encompass two separate areas in the Rio Grande Rift zone (Figure e). Three of the signatures (A, C, D) are associated with the Volcanic Field capture spatial variability within this province. Two signatures (E and F) represent the spatial variability in the Basin and Range province.

#### Description of location matrices (`W`)

The plot below shows location matrices (`W`) of the extracted signatures for all the accepted solutions together.
From left to right, the number of signatures increases.
The matrices are color-coded to show high (red) and low (green) associations between the locations and signatures.
Like the maps above, this figure below demonstrates how the signatures get transformed and modified as the number of signatures increases.
The transitions of the signatures show the consistencies of the obtained results.

![Ws](../figures-case01/locations.png)

Further observations based on the figure above are (note that these observations are consistent with the observations provided above regarding the physiographic provinces):

- The k=2 solution subdivides the SWNM into two subregions.
- Signatures A and B of the k=3 solution are split up into Signatures A, B, and C of the k=4 solution; however, Signature C of the k=3 solution and Signature D of the k=4 solution share very similar properties.
- Signatures A, B, C, and D of both the k=4 and 5 solutions possess similar properties; however, the k=5 solution got a completely new signature (Signature E).
- The k=8 solution regrouped the signatures of the k=5 solution. Signature A of the k=5 solution possesses similar properties to Signatures A and D of the k=8 solution. Signature B of the k=5 solution shares similar properties to Signatures E and F of the k=8 solution. Signature C of the k=5 solution has similar properties to both Signatures B and C of the k=8 solution. Signature D of the k=5 solution and both Signatures G and H of the k=8 solution share similar properties.
- It is critical to mention that although the 44 locations in the `W` matrices are labeled to be associated with a given geothermal signature (i.e., a certain region; A, B, etc.), it does not mean the locations are associated with only one signature as seen by the color-coding in the figure.
- Instead, it means that those locations predominantly dominate commensurate signatures with contributions from other signatures too.

#### Description of attribute matrices (`H`)

The plot below shows attribute matrices of all the accepted solutions.
The number of signatures increases from left to right.
The figure demonstrates how each attribute contributes to the extracted signature.
The matrices are color-coded to show high (red) and low (green) associations between the attributes and signatures.
Also, this plot shows how the signatures get transformed and modified as the number of signatures increases.
As above, the transitions of the signatures show the consistencies of the obtained ML results.

![Hs](../figures-case01/signals.png)

Further observations based on the figure above are:

- Signatures A, B, and C of the k=3 solution have similar properties to Signatures A, B, and both C and D of the k=4 solution, respectively.
- Signatures of A, B, C, and D of the k=4 solution possess similar properties to signatures both A and E, B, C, and D of the k=5 solution, respectively.
- Signatures A, B, C, D, and E of the k=5 solution share similar properties to both A and E, F, B, both G and H, and both C and D of the k=8 solution, respectively.

#### Optimal geothermal signatures charecterizing SWNM region

The figure below shows the map of the optimal signatures.
The k=5 solution best characterizes the spatial associations and geothermal attributes of the SWNM.
